    This include takes a piece of HTML as its .html parameter and outputs it both as a prettified codeblock
    and as the preview, unless a separate .preview parameter is passed. If you pass a preview parameter, it can
    either be a string (in which case that's the HTML that will be output) or it can be false, in which case
    there is no preview at all.
    
    If the preview and the codeblock use the same HTML (i.e. you did not pass a preview parameter), any line
    that contains the string "PREVIEW ONLY" (this should probably be in an HTML comment) will be rendered
    only in the preview, but skipped in the codeblock. Conversely, if the line contains "<!-- CODE ONLY -->", it will
    be rendered in the codeblock, but skipped in the preview (with this particular HTML comment removed).

    Usage:
    
    {% capture html %}
    <div class="my-awesome-html">Hello!</div>
    {% endcapture %}{% include example.html html=html %}

{% endcomment %}

    We're capturing the newline character in a variable. We could use a literal directly,
    but we're being defensive: While it does looks like Jekyll always normalizes line endings to \n
    no matter what's actually in the file, I'd like to make sure. The below is a poor man's assertion --
    if NEWLINE doesn't end up being \n, the attempt to include a non-existing file will cause an error.
{% endcomment %}

{% assign NEWLINE = '
' %}
{% assign encoded = NEWLINE | url_encode %}
{% if encoded != '%0A' %}{% include COULD_NOT_CAPTURE_NEWLINE_CHARACTER_CORRECTLY.html %}{% endif %}

    The below finds the minimum indentation, allowing us to dedent the HTML
    for the prettified display.
{% endcomment %}

{% assign lines = include.html | split: NEWLINE | %}
{% assign minindent = -1 %}
{% for line in lines %}
    {% assign line = line | strip_newlines %}
    {% assign strippedlength = line | lstrip | size %}
    
    {% comment %} Liquid has no "contains" filter as far as I can tell. {% endcomment %}
    {% assign removed = line | remove: "PREVIEW ONLY" %}
    
    {% if strippedlength > 0 and removed == line %}
        {% assign linelength = line | strip_newlines | size %}
        {% assign indent = linelength | minus: strippedlength %}
        {% if minindent == -1 or indent < minindent %}
            {% assign minindent = indent %}
        {% endif %}
